# Drivy Backend Challenge

I answered level by level and tested my solutions deeper and deeper depending on the levels.
In the first levels, edge cases should break the code. In the later levels it however shouldn't.

You can also find in the 5th level a documentation (in documentation.md) to better understand my final solution. Also since a failure behaviour wasn't provided so in level5, a crash behaviour is provided in the doc.
